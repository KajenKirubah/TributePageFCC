Using webpack, postcss, webpack-dev-server and other features to build a mobile responsive website about Dr. Normal Borlaugh.  According to what I've read about him, he was a great man.

Also new for this project, used package postcss-simple-vars for the first time, and it works really well.  I like it better than the built in variable feature, its more simple.
